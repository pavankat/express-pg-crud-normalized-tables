# Creating DB, Executing Schema file and Importing data in

* get into postgreSQL console:

```psql ```

* create the sauce_db database:

```CREATE DATABASE sauce_db;```

* in psql while connected to the sauce_db database, import the schema.sql file:

```
\i <path to the file>/schema.sql
```

* This needs to be done after the previous steps: in psql while connected to the sauce_db database, import the seed.sql file:

```
\i <path to the file>/seed.sql
```

# Part 1

Make these get routes work

	* app.get('/manufacturers/:id') -> render the manufacturer.handlebars file
	* app.get('/sauces') -> render the sauces.handlebars file
	* app.get('/customers') -> render the customers.handlebars fie
	* app.get('/customers/:id') -> render the customer.handlebars file

Make these new routes work
	* app.get('/new-manufacturer') -> render the new-manufacturer.handlebars

		* use a select drop dwon for manufacturer_id
	* app.get('/new-customer')  -> render the new-customer.handlebars
	* app.get('/new-customer-purchase')  -> render the new-customer-purchase.handlebars
		* use a the select drop down for customer_id
		* use a the select drop down for sauce_id

Make the create routes work
